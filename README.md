## üß† How It Works

### Personalized Context
The bot maintains comprehensive context about you:
- Your business idea and execution phase
- Daily activity streaks and patterns
- Goals and progress tracking
- Previous conversations and responses
- What motivates you vs. what blocks you

### AI-Powered Responses
Using Gemini AI, the bot provides:
- **Contextual Coaching**: References your specific history and patterns
- **Phase-Specific Advice**: Different guidance for planning vs. validation vs. MVP phases
- **Resource-Aware Suggestions**: Recommendations for solo entrepreneurs with limited budgets
- **Pattern Recognition**: Learns what works for your specific situation

### Example Conversation Flow
```
User: I have an idea for an AI task manager but don't know if there's a market

Bot: [Uses Business Ideas Agent] 
Let me help you explore this! AI task management is hot right now...

User: /research AI task management tools

Bot: [Uses Market Research Agent]
Here's what I found about the AI task management market...

User: This looks promising but I'm overwhelmed and don't know where to start

Bot: [Uses Execution Coach with your context]
I see you're in the validation phase with a 3-day streak. Based on your pattern, 
you break through overwhelm by starting with one tiny action. Here's your 
5-minute task: find and message one person who struggles with task management...
```
